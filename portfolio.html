	<h1>This is our game, "Build a St.Bernard Simulator". 
	A fun game where people can customize their own dog 
	(kind of like build a bear but dog version) and they 
	can do so by choosing colors for the dog and answering 
	questions about the dogâ€™s personality and specifics. You can 
	spend endless hours making very different dogs and
	will never get bored. It was made in the span of three days, 
	but is still very fun!</h1>

	<h1>   This is our Higher/Lower game. A game where you can choose 
	    any maximum value you want. You then have to guess a number in that range. 
	    The game will keep telling you if your guess is higher or lower untill you get 
	    to the desired digit. There is also a scoreboard where you can see yourself 
	    compared to other people.</h1>
